# React Hook Form Migration

## Overview

This document describes the migration from a custom state-based form implementation to React Hook Form with Zod validation for the new session form.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added

- `react-hook-form` - For form state management and validation
- `@hookform/resolvers` - For Zod schema integration
- `zod` - For runtime validation schemas

### 2. Validation Schema (`src/lib/validation-schemas.ts`)

Created comprehensive validation schemas using Zod:

- `sessionFormSchema` - Base validation for all session form fields
- `higherAccuracySchema` - Extended validation for higher accuracy mode
- Type-safe validation with custom error messages
- Real-time validation on form changes

### 3. Form Component Updates (`src/components/new-session/new-session-form.tsx`)

- Replaced `useState` with `useForm` hook
- Integrated Zod validation via `zodResolver`
- Added real-time validation with `mode: "onChange"`
- Updated form submission to use React Hook Form's `handleSubmit`
- Added validation for higher accuracy mode requirements

### 4. Component Interface Updates

Updated all form components to:

- Accept `errors` prop for displaying validation errors
- Use typed `handleInputChange` function with `keyof SessionFormSchema`
- Display validation errors with red borders and error messages
- Maintain existing functionality while adding validation

### 5. Validation Features

- **Real-time validation**: Form validates as user types
- **Field-level errors**: Individual field validation with specific error messages
- **Visual feedback**: Red borders and error messages for invalid fields
- **Form state tracking**: `isValid` prop controls submit button state
- **Higher accuracy validation**: Additional validation when higher accuracy mode is enabled

## Benefits

### Before (Custom State)

- Manual validation in `handleSubmit`
- No real-time feedback
- Validation logic scattered throughout components
- No type safety for form fields

### After (React Hook Form + Zod)

- Centralized validation schema
- Real-time validation feedback
- Type-safe form handling
- Better user experience with immediate feedback
- Easier to maintain and extend validation rules

## Usage

The form now automatically validates:

- Required fields (date, time, duration, device, unit, unitAmount, thcPercentage, cbdPercentage)
- Numeric constraints (duration 1-300, unitAmount 1-10, percentages 0-100)
- Higher accuracy mode requirements when enabled
- Form submission is blocked until all validation passes

## Error Display

Validation errors are displayed:

- Below each field with red text
- With red borders around invalid fields
- In real-time as the user types
- With specific, helpful error messages

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Form submission logic updated to use React Hook Form
- Component interfaces updated to accept `errors` prop
- Validation now happens before form submission, preventing bad data
- Better user experience with immediate feedback
